# Future Work
- GPS Module Integration: Implement a real interface with GPS modules for dynamic location updates.
- Magnetometer Support: Integrate the HMC5883L magnetometer to enhance directional accuracy and provide precise compass readings.
- Custom Linux Image: Embed the code into a custom-made Linux image using the Yocto project.
